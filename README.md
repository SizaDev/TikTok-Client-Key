# 🎟️ TikTok Client Token Generator

This Python script creates a secure, signed token that mimics TikTok’s internal `tt-ticket-guard-client-data` format. It's commonly used for accessing private API endpoints requiring encrypted timestamp verification.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Dynamically generates a Unix timestamp
- Signs it using **HMAC-SHA512** with a provided Base64 key
- Builds a request payload with predefined fields
- Encodes the final structure to **Base64** — ready to use as an HTTP header

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

 - Use the printed token in your headers:
   ```
   tt-ticket-guard-client-data: key
   ```

## 🧠 Developer Notes

- The `key_b64` used here must match TikTok’s client expectations (this script assumes you already have it).
- Replace `"req_sign"` with a valid signed string if required by the target endpoint.
